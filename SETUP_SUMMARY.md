# Rider Tracker App - Setup Summary

This document summarizes all the setup improvements that have been made to the Rider Tracker App to make it easier for developers to get started.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Platform-Specific Setup Scripts

Created three setup scripts for different operating systems to automate the development environment setup:

#### Windows Setup Script (`scripts/setup-windows.js`)
- Automatically checks for and installs pnpm if missing
- Creates `.env` file from `.env.example` or generates a basic one
- Installs all project dependencies
- Provides clear next steps for developers

#### macOS Setup Script (`scripts/setup-macos.sh`)
- Bash script for macOS environments
- Checks for pnpm and installs if missing
- Creates `.env` file
- Installs dependencies
- Provides usage instructions

#### Linux Setup Script (`scripts/setup-linux.sh`)
- Bash script for Linux environments
- Similar functionality to macOS script with Linux-specific package manager references
- Handles different Linux distributions (Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/RHEL, Fedora)

#### Package.json Updates
Added new scripts to `package.json`:
- `setup:windows`: Run the Windows setup script
- `setup:macos`: Run the macOS setup script
- `setup:linux`: Run the Linux setup script

Developers can now run `pnpm run setup:windows` (or corresponding OS) for automatic setup.

### 2. ✅ FRP Guide for Remote Access

Created a comprehensive `docs/frp-guide.md` that includes:

#### Server-Side Setup
- Downloading and installing FRP on a public server
- Configuring `frps.ini` for reverse proxy
- Setting up systemd service for automatic startup
- Firewall configuration instructions

#### Client-Side Setup
- Downloading and installing FRP on development machine
- Configuring `frpc.ini` for Rider Tracker App
- Running FRP client to expose local development server

#### Integration with Rider Tracker
- Specific configuration for exposing the Nuxt development server (port 3000)
- HTTPS certificate setup with Let's Encrypt
- Security considerations and best practices

### 3. ✅ Documentation Updates

#### Main README.md Updates
- Added information about setup scripts to main README.md
- Added section about FRP setup with link to the detailed guide
- Improved quick start options

#### Scripts README.md
- Created `scripts/README.md` with detailed usage instructions
- Added notes about making shell scripts executable on Unix systems

## Benefits for Developers

1. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can run a single command to set up their environment
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Scripts work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. **Remote Testing**: FRP guide enables mobile testing of geolocation features
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear instructions for all setup scenarios
5. **Time Savings**: Automated setup reduces configuration time from minutes to seconds

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows
pnpm run setup:windows

# macOS
pnpm run setup:macos

# Linux
pnpm run setup:linux
```

### Manual Setup
If you prefer to set up manually:
1. Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`
2. Create `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Update `.env` with your actual API keys
5. Run development server: `pnpm dev`

### Making Shell Scripts Executable (macOS/Linux)
On Unix systems, you may need to make the scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup-macos.sh
chmod +x scripts/setup-linux.sh
```
