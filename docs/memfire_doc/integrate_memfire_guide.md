# Memfire Integration Guide for Rider Tracker App

## Project Overview

This guide outlines the complete integration process for migrating your GPS rider tracking app from Supabase to **Memfire Cloud**, a Supabase-compatible backend-as-a-service platform. The migration will leverage Memfire's compatible API while potentially enhancing features and performance.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Already Implemented
- Environment variables configured for Memfire (`memfireUrl`, `memfireAnonKey`)
- Database schema fully defined with RLS policies
- Composable architecture using Vue 3 patterns
- HTTPS development environment for geolocation API

### 🔄 Needs Migration/Enhancement
- Complete database migration to Memfire
- File storage implementation for ride photos/avatars
- Real-time features for live ride tracking
- Enhanced profile management
- Performance optimizations

## Memfire Services Mapping

### Core Services Available in Memfire

| Service | Current Usage | Memfire Enhancement | Priority |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Database** | PostgreSQL with RLS | Same API, potentially better performance | High |
| **Authentication** | Email/password auth | Same API, enhanced security | High |
| **File Storage** | Not implemented | Profile avatars, ride photos | Medium |
| **Real-time** | Not implemented | Live ride tracking, notifications | Medium |
| **Edge Functions** | Not implemented | Route calculations, data processing | Low |

## Immediate Implementation Guide

### What Can Be Done NOW

#### 1. Environment Setup
```typescript
// Update nuxt.config.ts - Already configured! ✅
runtimeConfig: {
  public: {
    memfireUrl: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_MEMFIRE_URL,
    memfireAnonKey: process.env.NUXT_PUBLIC_MEMFIRE_ANON_KEY,
  }
}
```

#### 2. Create .env file:
```bash
# Memfire Configuration
NUXT_PUBLIC_MEMFIRE_URL=https://your-project.memfire.com
NUXT_PUBLIC_MEMFIRE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Amap Configuration (Already set)
NUXT_PUBLIC_AMAP_KEY=your_amap_key
NUXT_PUBLIC_AMAP_SECURITY_KEY=your_security_key
```

#### 3. Database Schema Migration
Your existing `database/schema.sql` is ready to run in Memfire! Just execute it in the Memfire SQL console.

#### 4. Test Current Implementation
The existing `composables/useSupabase.ts` should work with Memfire without changes due to API compatibility.

## Service Integration Patterns

### 1. Database Operations (useSupabase.ts) - Ready ✅
```typescript
// Current implementation is Memfire-compatible
const { supabase } = useSupabase()
// All existing CRUD operations work as-is
```

### 2. File Storage Integration (New Feature)
```typescript
// New composable: composables/useStorage.ts
export const useStorage = () => {
  const { supabase } = useSupabase()
  
  const uploadAvatar = async (file: File, userId: string) => {
    const fileName = `${userId}-${Date.now()}`
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .storage
      .from('avatars')
      .upload(fileName, file)
    
    return { data, error }
  }
  
  const uploadRidePhoto = async (file: File, rideId: string) => {
    const fileName = `${rideId}-${Date.now()}`
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .storage
      .from('ride-photos')
      .upload(fileName, file)
    
    return { data, error }
  }
  
  return { uploadAvatar, uploadRidePhoto }
}
```

### 3. Real-time Features (New Feature)
```typescript
// New composable: composables/useRealtime.ts
export const useRealtime = () => {
  const { supabase } = useSupabase()
  
  const subscribeToRideUpdates = (rideId: string, callback: Function) => {
    return supabase
      .channel(`ride:${rideId}`)
      .on('postgres_changes', {
        event: '*',
        schema: 'public',
        table: 'route_points',
        filter: `ride_id=eq.${rideId}`
      }, callback)
      .subscribe()
  }
  
  return { subscribeToRideUpdates }
}
```
